The Visual Designer at `/start` provides a canvas-based interface for creating application screens. Design visually with tldraw, then generate production React code.

## Interface Overview

## Design Specs

Configure your design before generating:

### Mode

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Wireframe">
    **Black and white structural mockups**
    
    Creates tldraw shapes representing your UI layout. Perfect for:
    - Quick concept exploration
    - Layout planning
    - Stakeholder reviews
    
    Wireframes don't require a sandbox - they're pure tldraw shapes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HiFi">
    **Full React/Tailwind code with styling**
    
    Generates complete, runnable React components. Includes:
    - Real UI components (buttons, inputs, cards)
    - Tailwind CSS styling with colors
    - Interactive elements
    - Responsive design
    
    Requires a sandbox for live preview.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Page Type

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Normal** | Standard single-viewport screen | App screens, dashboards |
| **Landingpage** | Multi-section scrolling page | Marketing pages, homepages |
| **Funnel** | Multi-step conversion flow | Signup flows, checkout |

For Landingpage and Funnel types, configure the **Sections** slider (3-20 sections). Each section adds one viewport height to the generated page.

### Screen Size

Choose from preset screen sizes:

| Size | Dimensions | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Desktop | 1440 × 1024 | Standard desktop apps |
| Desktop HD | 1920 × 1080 | Full HD displays |
| Tablet | 1024 × 1366 | iPad and tablets |
| Mobile | 375 × 840 | Smartphones |

## Single Screen Generation

The default mode for generating one screen at a time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure design specs">
    Set mode (Wireframe/HiFi), page type, and screen size.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your prompt">
    Describe the screen you want to create:
    ```
    A user profile settings page with:
    - Profile photo upload
    - Name and email fields
    - Password change section
    - Notification preferences toggles
    - Delete account button (danger zone)
    Modern design with a clean white background
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add reference images (optional)">
    Drag and drop images or click the paperclip icon to upload design references.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Generate">
    The AI generates your screen and displays it on the canvas.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Prompt Enhancement

Click the **Enhance** button (wand icon) to have AI expand your prompt with more specific design details. This often produces better results for simple prompts.

## Flow Generation

Create multiple related screens in one operation.

### Autoflow

Let AI plan the screens for your app:

1. Switch to **Create Flow** tab
2. Enter your app context:
   ```
   E-commerce mobile app for a fashion brand.
   Users can browse products, add to cart, 
   checkout, and track orders.
   Modern minimal design with smooth animations.
   ```
3. Optionally set the number of screens (leave empty for AI to decide)
4. Click **Autoflow**

The AI generates a list of screens with names and prompts:

```
1. Home - Product discovery with featured items and categories
2. Product Detail - Full product view with images, sizes, add to cart
3. Cart - Shopping cart with item list, quantities, totals
4. Checkout - Shipping, payment, order confirmation
5. Orders - Order history and tracking
```

### Manual Screen List

You can also manually create and edit the screen list:

- **Drag to reorder** screens using the grip handle
- **Edit names** by clicking on the screen title
- **Modify prompts** in the text area
- **Remove screens** with the minus button
- **Clear all** to start over

### Generate Flow

Click **Generate Flow** to create all screens simultaneously. They appear side-by-side on the canvas.

## Advanced Options

### Deep Design

Toggle **Deep Design** for enhanced AI reasoning:

- More thorough prompt analysis
- Better component structure
- Improved accessibility considerations
- Higher quality code output

Uses more tokens but produces better results for complex screens.

### Max Mode

Toggle **Max Mode** to use the most capable AI model available:

- Best code quality
- Slower generation
- Higher cost

Recommended for production-quality output.

## Reference Images

Upload images to guide the AI's design:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Drag & Drop" icon="upload">
    Drag images directly onto the prompt area.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Click to Upload" icon="paperclip">
    Click the paperclip icon to select files.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF

### Best Practices for Reference Images

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Screenshots of existing apps">
    Show the AI exactly the style you're going for.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Figma/Sketch exports">
    Use high-quality mockups for pixel-perfect results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Color palettes">
    Include color swatches to match brand colors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Component examples">
    Show specific UI patterns you want to use.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working with Generated Screens

### On the Canvas

Generated screens appear as frames on the tldraw canvas:

- **Pan**: Hold space and drag, or use two-finger scroll
- **Zoom**: Scroll or pinch to zoom
- **Select**: Click on a screen to select it
- **Move**: Drag selected screens to reposition

### View Code

Click on any generated HiFi screen to see its React code. Use the **Copy** button to grab the code.

### Edit with AI

Open the Sandbox Panel and use the [AI Coder](/seemodo/ai-coder) to:

- Modify specific components
- Add new features
- Fix issues
- Change styling

### Download Project

Click the download button in the Sandbox Panel to get a ZIP file with:

- All source files
- `package.json` with dependencies
- Vite configuration
- Ready to run locally

## Generation History

Click the **History** button (clock icon) to see previous generations:

- View all past prompts
- See screen dimensions and mode
- Click **Use Prompt** to reuse a previous prompt

History persists during your session.

## Tips for Best Results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start simple">
    Generate basic layouts first, then iterate with AI to add complexity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Be descriptive">
    Include colors, spacing, typography preferences in your prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use reference images">
    One good reference image is worth a thousand words.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate with flows">
    Use Create Flow for consistent design across multiple screens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Deep Design">
    For production screens, the extra processing time is worth it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

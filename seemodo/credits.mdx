Seemodo uses a credit system to manage usage across different actions. Credits are consumed when you generate screens, edit code, or clone websites.

## How Credits Work

Each action in Seemodo costs a specific number of credits:

| Action | Credit Cost | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Generate Screen | 6 credits | Create a new screen from a prompt |
| Edit Screen | 4 credits | Modify an existing screen |
| Clone Website | 8 credits | Clone a website's design |
| Autoflow | 10 credits | Generate multiple related screens |
| AI Chat Message | 1-2 credits | Interact with the AI coder |

## Checking Your Balance

View your current credit balance:

1. Open the Seemodo app
2. Look at the **Generations** counter in the sidebar
3. Or go to `/account` for detailed usage

The generation counter shows your total successful generations. Your remaining credits are displayed in the account dashboard.

## Credit-Saving Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use wireframe mode for exploration">
    Wireframe mode doesn't consume credits - use it to explore ideas before committing to HiFi generation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refine prompts before generating">
    Spend time crafting a detailed prompt. A single good generation is better than multiple attempts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use the AI chat for small changes">
    Small edits via AI chat (1-2 credits) are cheaper than regenerating the entire screen (6 credits).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leverage Autoflow for related screens">
    Autoflow (10 credits) is more efficient than generating 5 screens separately (30 credits).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upload reference images">
    Reference images help the AI understand your vision, reducing the need for multiple attempts.

This guide covers common issues and their solutions when working with Seemodo.

## Sandbox Issues

### Sandbox not starting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check provider configuration">
    Verify your `.env` file has the correct settings:
    ```env
    SANDBOX_PROVIDER=modal
    MODAL_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.modal.run
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Modal deployment">
    Ensure your Modal backend is deployed and running:
    ```bash
    cd modal-backend
    modal deploy main.py
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check network connectivity">
    Your browser must be able to reach the Modal backend URL. Test in a new tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review browser console">
    Open DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for error messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Preview not loading

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Blank iframe | Vite not ready | Wait 5-10 seconds, then refresh |
| Build error | Code error | Check AI chat for error messages |
| Timeout | Sandbox expired | Generate a new screen to restart |
| CORS error | Tunnel issue | Try refreshing the page |

### Sandbox keeps timing out

The default timeout is 60 minutes. To extend:

1. Modify `config/app.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   modal: {
     timeoutMinutes: 120, // 2 hours
   }
   ```
2. Redeploy the Modal backend

## AI Generation Issues

### Generation fails

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API key">
    Verify your AI provider keys in `.env`:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_valid_key_here
    ```
    
    Test the key by making a direct API call.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rate limiting">
    If you're making many requests, you may hit rate limits. Wait a few minutes and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt too complex">
    Very long or complex prompts may fail. Try:
    - Breaking into smaller pieces
    - Using Plan mode for complex features
    - Being more specific about what you want
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Model unavailable">
    If a specific model fails, try a different one:
    - Add `?model=true` to the URL
    - Select an alternative model
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Poor quality output

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Deep Design mode">
    Enable Deep Design in the sidebar for better results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add reference images">
    Upload screenshots or mockups to guide the AI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Be more specific">
    Instead of "make it pretty", specify colors, layout, and components.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try a different model">
    Some models are better for certain types of designs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AI not responding

If the Seemodo AI panel shows "Thinking" indefinitely:

1. Check the connection indicator (should be green)
2. Click the Reconnect button
3. Refresh the page if needed
4. Check if the sandbox is still running

## Code Issues

### Build errors after generation

The AI automatically detects and fixes most build errors. If an error persists:

1. Check the error message in the AI chat
2. Ask the AI specifically to fix it:
   ```
   Fix the TypeScript error in Button.tsx
   ```
3. Review the generated code for obvious issues

### Missing packages

Packages are auto-installed, but sometimes fail:

```bash
# In the sandbox terminal
pnpm add package-name
```

Or ask the AI:
```
Install lodash and use it in the utils file
```

### HMR not working

If changes aren't reflecting in the preview:

1. Click "Restart Vite" in the terminal
2. Wait for the dev server to restart
3. Refresh the preview iframe

## Seemodo Cloud Issues

### Connection failed

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid project reference">
    The project reference is just the ID, not the full URL:
    - ✅ Correct: `abcdefghijklmnop`
    - ❌ Wrong: `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid API token">
    Get a new token from Supabase Dashboard → Account → Access Tokens.
    
    Ensure it has the required permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project paused">
    Free Supabase projects pause after inactivity. Visit the dashboard to resume.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Database operations failing

1. Check RLS policies aren't blocking the operation
2. Verify the table exists in the correct schema
3. Ask the AI to debug:
   ```
   Why is the insert into users table failing?
   ```

## Browser Issues

### Slow performance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Too many open tabs" icon="browser">
    Close other tabs, especially those with active sandboxes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser cache" icon="database">
    Clear cache and reload the page.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensions" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Disable browser extensions that might interfere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hardware acceleration" icon="microchip">
    Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled in browser settings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Canvas not loading

tldraw requires WebGL support:

1. Check that WebGL is enabled in your browser
2. Update your graphics drivers
3. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

## Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `SANDBOX_NOT_FOUND` | Sandbox expired or doesn't exist | Generate a new screen |
| `SEEMODO_AI_CONNECTION_FAILED` | Can't reach Seemodo AI server | Wait for sandbox to fully initialize |
| `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE` | AI model is down | Try a different model |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many requests | Wait a few minutes |
| `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` | Out of credits | Purchase more or wait for refresh |
